# SICP Notes
Notes on the classic (infamous?) computer science book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) by Abelson and Sussman. Using guile-scheme with Emacs org-mode's [Babel](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/) feature for literate programming. 

### Aside 
I'm read a similar text called [Concrete Abstractions](https://gustavus.edu/+max/concrete-abstractions.html). CA covers a lot of the same material as SICP's first few sections in great detail (higher order procedures, hierarchical data, etc.), so my notes over those sections will be limited to the odd exercise or so.

### Links
If you're interested in reading SICP, you can't go wrong with the [original text](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html). There's also a lovely modernization effort available in EPUB and PDF format at https://github.com/sarabander/sicp.

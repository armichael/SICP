# SICP Notes
Notes on the classic (infamous?) computer science book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) by Hal Abelson and Gerald Sussman. 

### About 
Code is written in guile-scheme, using Emacs org-mode's [Babel](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/) feature for literate programming. 

I've read a similar text called [Concrete Abstractions](https://gustavus.edu/+max/concrete-abstractions.html). CA covers a lot of the same material as SICP's first few sections in great detail, so my notes over those sections will be limited to the odd exercise or so.

### Links
If you're interested in reading SICP, you can't go wrong with the [original text](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html). There's also a lovely modernization effort available in EPUB and PDF format at https://github.com/sarabander/sicp.

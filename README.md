Notes on the classic (infamous?) computer science book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) by Abelson and Sussman.

I'm diving into SICP after having made it much of the way through a similar book called *Concrete Abstractions*[1]. CA covers a lot of the same material as SICP's firsst few sections in great detail, so my notes over those sections will be limited to the odd exercise or so.
